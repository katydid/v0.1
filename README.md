playground for katydid hacked from play.golang.org

This is a website like play.golang.org for github.com/katydid/katydid.
It requires multiple text boxes each with a different purpose.

1. Define a protocol buffer
2. Populate a protocol buffer
3. Run a query

This is probably some of the worst code I have written in a long time.
I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this and wanted to make it pluggable for new things as I go along.
I refuse to pay the web tax (learning javascript) so I did some horrible things to avoid this.
I also believe that this website will be very hackable.
Designing a query language is hard enough.  I prefer to focus on that.
Use or Fork at own risk.
